# Weather Analysis for Travel Planning 

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project was to enhance the PlanMyTrip app previously created, by allowing users to use input statements to filter data containing over 700 cities destinations for their weather preference. Once users decided on their weather preference, they were able to create an itinerary by identifying 4 potential travel destinations from the filtered list. Using Google Maps Directions API, a travel route with markers was created for the user's chosen cities.
